/*
Project:
Contributers: 

List of things that still need to be done:
Buttons formatted, colored, and that fun stuff
The frames need to be added
Currently the window completely freezes once button 1 is hit and will not close
Cases need all of their buttons added in
All of the dialog still needs to be added

List of things I would like to do but may not have time:
Convert the button if statements to switch statements (Low prio)
Allow user to hit z to scroll through the text rather than hitting a button

TLDR: Needs reorganization
